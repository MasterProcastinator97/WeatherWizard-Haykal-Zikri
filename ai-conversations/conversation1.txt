# Conversation Title: Debugging and Refining the DataFrame Output
# Date: October 17, 2025
# Summary: This conversation documents a targeted bug fix. The initial function was creating a messy output table with the current day's data split across two rows. The user requested help to clean this up, leading to a more efficient and correct data processing logic.

Me:
"I've noticed a bug in the output from my `get_weather_data` function. 
The table it creates is messy because the current day's weather is split into two separate rows
one for the current conditions and another for the daily forecast. 
Can you please help me correct the function so that it produces a single, clean row for each forecast day?"

AI:
Excellent catch! That's a great observation, and it's a common issue when combining different data sources. The bug happens because you're creating two separate DataFrames (one for 'current' and one for 'forecast') and then concatenating them.

A much cleaner and more efficient approach is to build a single, unified list of all the forecast data first, and then create just one DataFrame from that list at the end.

Here is the corrected version of the function.


### BEFORE:
```python
# This version creates two separate DataFrames (`current_df` and `forecast_df`)
# and then uses pd.concat() to join them. This leads to the misaligned rows in the output.
def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
    # ... (API call logic) ...
    try:
        # ... (API request code) ...
        raw_data = response.json()

        # Creates the first DataFrame for only the current conditions
        current = raw_data['list'][0]
        current_condition = {
            'Condition': [current['weather'][0]['description']],
            'Temperature (°C)': [int(current['main']['temp'])],
            # ... other current condition fields
        }
        current_df = pd.DataFrame(current_condition)

        # Creates a second DataFrame for the forecast
        daily_forecasts_list = []
        # ... (loop to populate daily_forecasts_list) ...
        forecast_df = pd.DataFrame(daily_forecasts_list)

        # Combines the two, causing the formatting bug
        combined_df = pd.concat([current_df, forecast_df], ignore_index=True)
        combined_df = combined_df.fillna('')
        return combined_df
    except Exception as e:
        # ... (error handling) ...
        return None
