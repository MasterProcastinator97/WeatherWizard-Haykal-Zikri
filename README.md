## 🖥️ Key Features

- **API Integration:** Calls the OpenWeatherMap 5‑day/3‑hour endpoint.
- **Tidy DataFrame:** Combines a “Current” row with daily forecast rows (date, description, max/min temp, chance of rain).
- **Visualisations:** Temperature line chart and chance‑of‑rain bar chart.
- **Error Handling:** Clear messages for missing API key, invalid location (404), unauthorised (401), and timeouts.
- **Intentional Prompting Evidence:** Five commented conversations inside the code cells (foundation, clarification, constraints, edge cases, reflection).
