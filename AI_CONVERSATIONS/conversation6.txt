# Conversation Title: Developing the Natural Language Interface
# Date: October 18, 2025
# Summary: This conversation documents the step-by-step creation of the natural language interface. It shows how intentional prompting was used to first design a simple parsing strategy, then build the parsing and response functions, and finally refine the responses to be more user-friendly and context-aware.

AI: Gemini

Me:
I'm ready to build the natural language interface for my Weather Advisor. I need to create a function that can understand a user's question, like 'what is the temperature in Perth tomorrow?'.

I want to use a simple, rule-based approach with Python string methods and keyword matching, rather than a complex NLP library. Could you help me outline a step-by-step strategy for building this?"

AI:
That's an excellent approach. A rule-based parser is perfect for this task. Here’s a solid strategy:

Define Keywords: Create dictionaries for time periods ('today', 'tomorrow') and weather attributes ('temperature', 'rain', 'humidity').

Build the Parser: Write a function parse_weather_question that iterates through the user's input, finds these keywords, and stores them.

Extract the Location: Assume the remaining words in the sentence, after removing keywords and filler words, make up the location.

Build the Responder: Write a second function generate_weather_response that takes the parsed information and the weather DataFrame to construct a human-readable sentence.

Would you like to start by creating the parse_weather_question function?

Me:
Yes lets start with parse_weather_question. Please implement it following that strategy. It should take a question string and return a dictionary containing the extracted 'location', 'time_period', and 'attribute'."

AI:
Here is the implementation of the parser function based on our keyword strategy.

def parse_weather_question(question):
    # ... (AI provides the initial parsing logic) ...


Me:
okay I have a question about the location logic. The heuristic of using the 'leftover' words is clever. How would this handle a multi-word city like 'New York'? Also, could we add default values so that if a time or attribute isnt specified, it defaults to 'today' and a general 'Description'?

AI:
Excellent questions. That's a key part of making it robust.

Multi-word cities: The current logic handles this well. By removing all other known keywords, the remaining words (e.g., 'new', 'york') are joined together to form the full location name.

Default values: That's a great idea for user experience. I will update the function to default to 'today' for the time period and 'Description' for the attribute if they aren't found in the query.

Here is the refined code.

### BEFORE:

# The initial version might not have had defaults, potentially failing on simple queries.
def parse_weather_question(question):
    # ... logic without default values ...
    parsed_info = { "location": None, "time_period": None, "attribute": None }
    # ...
    return parsed_info


### AFTER 

# The refined version is more robust with default values.
def parse_weather_question(question):
    # ... (keyword definitions) ...
    parsed_info = {
        "location": None,
        "time_period": "today",  # Default to today
        "time_index": 0,         
        "attribute": "Description" # Default to general description
    }
    # ... (logic to overwrite defaults if keywords are found) ...
    return parsed_info


Me:
Now let's create the generate_weather_response function. It needs to take the parsed dictionary and the pandas DataFrame from get_weather_data as input.

Could you also make the responses more context-aware? For example, if the rain chance is high, it could add a friendly suggestion like 'bring an umbrella'. This will make the advisor feel more intelligent."

AI:
Of course. Adding conditional logic to the response generator is a great touch. This function will select the correct data from the DataFrame using the parsed time_index and attribute, and then format it into a sentence with that extra bit of personality.

Here is the implementation that matches the code you're using.

# This function uses the parsed info to look up data in the DataFrame
# and includes conditional logic for the 'Rain Chance (%)' attribute.

def generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_df):
    """
    Generates a natural language response based on the parsed question and weather data.
    """
    location = parsed_question.get("location")
    time_period = parsed_question.get("time_period", "today")
    time_index = parsed_question.get("time_index", 0)
    attribute = parsed_question.get("attribute", "Description")

    # --- Validation ---
    if not location:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't figure out which location you're asking about. Please try again."
        
    if weather_df is None or weather_df.empty:
        return f"Sorry, I couldn't retrieve any weather data for {location}."

    if time_index >= len(weather_df):
        return f"Sorry, I only have a {len(weather_df)}-day forecast. I can't provide data for '{time_period}'."

    # --- Data Retrieval from DataFrame ---
    try:
        requested_data = weather_df.iloc[time_index]
        value = requested_data[attribute]
    except (IndexError, KeyError):
        return f"Sorry, I couldn't find the '{attribute}' data for {location}."

    # --- Response Generation ---
    location_name = location.split(',')[0] 

    if attribute == "Max Temp (°C)":
        return f"The forecasted high temperature for {location_name} {time_period} is {value}°C."
    elif attribute == "Min Temp (°C)":
        return f"The forecasted low temperature for {location_name} {time_period} is {value}°C."
    elif attribute == "Rain Chance (%)":
        if value > 50:
            return f"There's a {value}% chance of rain in {location_name} {time_period}. You might want to bring an umbrella!"
        else:
            return f"The chance of rain in {location_name} {time_period} is low, at {value}%."
    elif attribute == "Humidity (%)":
        return f"The humidity in {location_name} {time_period} is expected to be around {value}%."
    elif attribute == "Description":
        return f"The weather outlook for {location_name} {time_period} is: {value}."
    else:
        return f"For {location_name} {time_period}, the {attribute} is {value}."
