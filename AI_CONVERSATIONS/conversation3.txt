# Conversation Title: Locking OpenWeatherMap API Key secrets
# Date: October 16, 2025
# Here's a summary of our recent interaction focusing on setting up the OpenWeatherMap API key:
# AI: Gemini

Me: "Verify OpenWeatherMap API key is correctly set"

AI: added a code cell (92241014) to check and print the status of the OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable.
Me: "Explain the 401 error in the last cell"

AI: I discussed the meaning of a 401 Unauthorized error in the context of API calls, explaining it usually indicates an invalid or incorrect API key.
Me: "Modify the code in the selected cell based on the requirements, remember to include the modified cell id(s) in your response. Requirements: how do i want the api key to be locked once keyed in"

AI: the existing code in cell AUHh2TzF5u3t already prevents repeated prompts within the same session if the environment variable is set.
Me: "Modify the code in the selected cell based on the requirements, remember to include the modified cell id(s) in your response. Requirements: but i have to put the api key again anad again if this notebook disconnect. i dont want that"

AI: for persistence across sessions, Colab's Secrets feature should be used.
Modified Cell (AUHh2TzF5u3t):

### BEFORE:
        # Setting up the OpenWeathermap API key
        import os
        import getpass

        if 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
          api_key = getpass.getpass('Enter your OpenWeatherMap API key: ')
          os.environ['OPENWEATHER_API_KEY'] = api_key

### AFTER:
        # Setting up the OpenWeathermap API key using Colab Secrets
        from google.colab import userdata
        import os

        # Access the API key from Colab Secrets
        api_key = userdata.get('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY')

        # Set it as an environment variable for compatibility with the existing function
        if api_key:
            os.environ['OPENWEATHER_API_KEY'] = api_key
        else:
            print("OpenWeatherMap API Key not found in Colab Secrets. Please add it using the üîë icon.")

# Conversation 3 ‚Äî Locking API Key Secrets
#
# User:
# I‚Äôm running in Colab. What‚Äôs the safest way to store the OpenWeatherMap key so it never appears in outputs?
#
# AI:
# ‚ÄúUse Tools ‚Üí Secrets to add OPENWEATHER_API_KEY. Access via os.environ.get('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY').
# Never print the key; only print whether it‚Äôs set.‚Äù
#
# User:
# What if the key is missing‚Äîwhat should I show, should I exit?
#
# AI:
# ‚ÄúPrint ‚ÄòAPI key not found‚Äîadd it via Colab Secrets.‚Äô Return None or an error DataFrame rather than exiting, so the notebook remains testable.‚Äù
