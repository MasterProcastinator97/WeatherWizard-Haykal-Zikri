# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?

I used both ChatGPT and Gemini to do this project. I mostly used ChatGPT to navigate around GitHub because it's complex for a first timer, and quick questions regarding code languages and reviews. ChatGPT was very helpful as it was better than Gemini in terms of remembering the main purpose of the assignment. For my main prompts, I used Gemini to improve my code, find errors, and overall make my code organised neatly. So, Gemini, help me in explaining the context of the code better than ChatGPT.

## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?

First, I used simple, grounding prompts to restate the task and agree on its scope, covering inputs, outputs, and what constitutes as done. Then I asked focused follow-ups to break the work into parts: fetching the data, shaping it into a clean table, and producing readable visuals. I set clear guardrails, such as maintaining the same columns and never exposing the API key, and I verified assumptions, including what happens if a field is missing. When something looked off, I treated it like a small experiment, asking for a likely cause and a minimal, safe fix I could apply without breaking anything. I also requested graceful fallbacks, clear error messages, and subtle UI polish on titles and labels. 

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.

I am proud that, for a person that have no experience in coding, I was able to finish this assignment by learning from the mistakes I made when generating the code. It was a good experience, and you could see coding as a fun subject to get into.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.

I would definitely start the assignment earlier than expected and consult more with the lecturer regarding the task. I would love to spend more time on the natural language components, by making it more natural in responding to the user's questions. I want the weather advisor to be at a higher level, like Gemini.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?

I wish this unit were not a hybrid model and a lecture so that everyone can understand what they are doing. Yes, I know we could learn this because of the help of AI and colabs, but if the unit is like 3 hours for lecture and tutorial, that would be beneficial for the students. By doing this, it can help the student do the assignments and not just rely heavily on AI.
